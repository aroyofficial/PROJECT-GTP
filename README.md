# PROJECT GTP

<p align="justify">GTD is used as a training dataset in this project. We have used the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to train the model. We have predicted Country name, Terrorist organization name, and other parameters.  So, basically, this is a classification-based problem. On the other hand, It is a very large dataset and we are working on specific values. That is why we are going for the Decision Tree Classifier. We also use Random Forest Classifier i.e. one of the ensembling techniques to take advantage of different decision tree classifiers. After the model training phase we evaluate our model and we get the results are - True positive rate for prediction of country name is 66 %,  terrorist group name is 69 %, attack type is 83 %, weapon type 90 %,  target type is 50 %. The training phase takes a lot of time. So finally, we save our model using Python's Joblib module. So again and again training is not required. We also built a crime visualization model on different categories of crime. Here we have used 2001 - 2010 past criminal records. We create different types of graphs which show the distribution of different parameters of crimes at the district level and state level with the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn library. We have used Geopandas and Descartes library to plot intensity distribution through geographical maps. This model helps to recognize the crime patterns and it will help to solve the investigation process faster.</p>

<h3>Tools and Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>GTD : </b><p align = "justify">The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)™ is the most comprehensive unclassified database of terrorist attacks in the world. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) makes the GTD available via this site in an effort to improve understanding of terrorist violence, so that it can be more readily studied and defeated. The GTD is produced by a dedicated team of researchers and technical staff. The GTD is an open-source database, which provides information on domestic and international terrorist attacks around the world since 1970, and now includes more than 200,000 events. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including  the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible. </p></li>
