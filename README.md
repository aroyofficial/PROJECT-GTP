<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p align="justify">GTD is used as a training dataset in this project. We have used the Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier to train the model. We have predicted Country name, Terrorist organization name, and other parameters.  So, basically, this is a classification-based problem. On the other hand, It is a very large dataset and we are working on specific values. That is why we are going for the Decision Tree Classifier. We also use Random Forest Classifier i.e. one of the ensembling techniques to take advantage of different decision tree classifiers. After the model training phase we evaluate our model and we get the results are - True positive rate for prediction of country name is 66 %,  terrorist group name is 69 %, attack type is 83 %, weapon type 90 %,  target type is 50 %. The training phase takes a lot of time. So finally, we save our model using Python's Joblib module. So again and again training is not required. We also built a crime visualization model on different categories of crime. Here we have used 2001 - 2010 past criminal records. We create different types of graphs which show the distribution of different parameters of crimes at the district level and state level with the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn library. We have used Geopandas and Descartes library to plot intensity distribution through geographical maps. This model helps to recognize the crime patterns and it will help to solve the investigation process faster.</p>

<h3>Tools and Resources</h3>
<ul>
  <li><b>GTD : </b><p align = "justify">The Global Terrorism Database (GTD)™ is the most comprehensive unclassified database of terrorist attacks in the world. The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) makes the GTD available via this site in an effort to improve understanding of terrorist violence, so that it can be more readily studied and defeated. The GTD is produced by a dedicated team of researchers and technical staff. The GTD is an open-source database, which provides information on domestic and international terrorist attacks around the world since 1970, and now includes more than 200,000 events. For each event, a wide range of information is available, including  the date and location of the incident, the weapons used, nature of the target, the number of casualties, and – when identifiable – the group or individual responsible.</p></li>
  <li><b>NumPy : </b><p align = "justify">It is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.</p></li>
  <li><b>Pandas : </b><p align = "justify">It is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.</p></li>
  <li><b>Scikit Learn : </b><p align = "justify">Scikit-learn (formerly scikits.learn and also known as sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.</p></li>
  <li><b>Maplotlib : </b><p align = "justify">It is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK.</p></li>
  <li><b>Seaborn : </b><p align = "justify">Seaborn is a data visualization library built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures in Python. Visualization is the central part of Seaborn which helps in exploration and understanding of data.</p></li>
  <li><b>Geopandas : </b><p align = "justify">It is an open source project to make working with geospatial data in python easier. GeoPandas extends the datatypes used by pandas to allow spatial operations on geometric types. Geometric operations are performed by shapely. Geopandas further depends on fiona for file access and matplotlib for plotting.
</p></li>
  <li><b>Descartes : </b><p align = "justify">The Descartes library provides a nicer integration of Shapely geometry objects with Matplotlib. Here, you will see that descartes opens the fill and patch of matplotlib plots to work with the geometries from Shapely and saves you from typing them individually.</p></li>
  <li><b>Joblib : </b><p align = "justify">It is a set of tools to provide lightweight pipelining in Python. In particular: transparent disk-caching of functions and lazy re-evaluation (memoize pattern).</p></li>
